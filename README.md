## IPI

Welcome to the first repository of my Python coursework for the Introduction to Imperative Programming in my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

Throughout this coursework, I will be tackling various exercises with increasing levels of difficulty.

👨🏻‍💻 **What I'll Be Learning** 

- Basic Syntax and Variables:
I will learn how to write fundamental language instructions, declare and utilize variables to store data, and display results in the console. This involves understanding essential data types like integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and boolean values.

- Control Structures:
This is where I begin to understand how to manage the flow of program execution. It includes using conditional structures (such as if, elif, else) to make decisions based on conditions, as well as loops (for and while) to repeatedly execute code blocks.

- Functions:
As I progress, I'll become acquainted with defining and invoking functions. Functions enable the encapsulation of code into reusable and modular units, enhancing code organization and maintainability.

- Data Structures and Containers:
At this stage, I'll explore Python's data structures for data organization and storage. This encompasses lists (arrays), tuples, and dictionaries. I'll also delve into sets and their usage for managing unique data collections.

💪 **My Personal Goals**
- I will learn how to thoroughly test code.
- I'm committed to optimizing the code I produce.

❓**Do you have some advice or project idea to recomend me?**

Feel free to follow along as I embark on this exciting learning journey!
